# **AI for the Arts & Humanities Portfolio**

**Welcome to my portfolio for the *AI for the Arts & Humanities* module. This repository documents my learning journey, design thinking, and practical explorations using artificial intelligence tools—especially large language models (LLMs)—in creative, ethical, and inclusive ways.**

## Purpose and Goals

This repository is designed to:

- Present my project work and reflections for the course in a clear and accessible way.
- Demonstrate my understanding of Python programming fundamentals and their application in arts and humanities contexts.
- Explore the creative potential of AI technologies, particularly LLM - in addressing cultural, educational, and wellbeing challenges.
- Develop skills in coding, critical reflection, and technology design through interactive notebooks and prototypes.

## Target Audience

This project is intended for:

- Instructors and assessors of the *AI for the Arts & Humanities* module.
- Fellow students and collaborators exploring similar intersections of code, creativity, and culture.
- Anyone curious about how LLM can be applied ethically and imaginatively in arts, education, and mental health contexts.
