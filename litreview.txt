This review explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in administering therapy to young people, focusing on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and emotional engagement. This inquiry is valuable to mental health practitioners, AI developers, and policymakers seeking to understand the capabilities and limitations of AI in therapy. The focus is on youth mental health, a highly media-savvy generation often identified as the group most affected by evolving mental health service delivery. While AI enhances access, findings suggest it remains a supplementary tool rather than a replacement for human practitioners, imploring the need for ethical oversight and hybrid models.
